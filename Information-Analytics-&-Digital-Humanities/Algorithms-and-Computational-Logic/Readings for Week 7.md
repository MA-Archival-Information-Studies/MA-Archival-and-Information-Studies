# Readings for Week 7
# Algorithms and Computational Logic

Here are the readings for next week. Please read both. They are not specifically about the lecture, but they give a much needed understanding of the kind of questions that can be analysed algorithmically, and how one might approach them.

Both of these are in the Week 7 Readings folder on GitHub
