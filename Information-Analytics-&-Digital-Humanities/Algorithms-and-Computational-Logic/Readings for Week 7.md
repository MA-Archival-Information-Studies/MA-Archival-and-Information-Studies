# Readings for Week 7
# Algorithms and Computational Logic

Here are the readings for next week. Please read both articles even though they are not specifically about the lecture, but they give a much needed understanding of the kind of questions that can be analysed algorithmically, and how one might approach them.

I would definitely look at the YouTube video. It is of a talk given by the late Richard Feynmen about computers and computing. One of the best for getting your head around is called "computational logic".

Both of the articles are in the Week 7 Readings folder on GitHub
