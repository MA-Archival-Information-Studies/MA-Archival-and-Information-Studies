# Information Analytics Oral Exam

Dear all,

The oral exam will not hold any surprises as the questions, no more than 5, will come directly from the seminars. The questions will begin in a general way, (e.g. What is media for you?) and continue to some slightly more specific issues (e.g. How does such and such a media work?). Of course my example here will not be in the exam, but just to give you feel for the kind of questions you will get.

We will not ask you about any formula or technical detail, but you will be expected to discuss general principles and conditions of analysis. 

The oral will be a discussion with one of us asking you questions, and you answering. We will also prompt you, and interject. It is all very relaxed and more of a discussion than an exam. Try to relax!

Good luck.
