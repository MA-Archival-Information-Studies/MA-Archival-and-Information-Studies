# Weekly Assessments

Every Week in the first Block, in addition to the readings, you will be asked to do a short and simple assignment. These assignements are not marked, but are for your benefit and may be necessary for your completion of the assessed assignements. <br> **Please do them.**

The assignments will help you understand the next lesson better. Don't worry about doing them absolutely correctly, but use these weekly assignments as a trial run for the next lesson. Time will be given at the beginning of each lesson for questions about the assignments.

You will be expected to come prepared having read the material (there is not much) and done the assignment.

Classes will always include some talking (buy us) and some discussion (with all of us).

## Version Control System

^ Git was created by Linus Torvalds in 2005 for development of the Linux kernel, with other kernel developers contributing to its initial development. Its current maintainer is Junio Hamano.

^ As with most other distributed version control systems, and unlike most clientâ€“server systems, every Git directory on every computer is a full-fledged repository with complete history and full version-tracking capabilities, independent of network access or a central server.

^ Like the Linux kernel, Git is free software distributed under the terms of the GNU General Public License version 2.

^ The name "git" was given by Linus Torvalds when he wrote the very first version. He described the tool as "the stupid content tracker" and the name as (depending on your mood)

Characteristics

1. Strong support for non-linear development
    - Git supports rapid branching and merging, and includes specific tools for visualizing and navigating a non-linear development history. 

1. Distributed development
    - Git gives each developer a local copy of the entire development history, and changes are copied from one such repository to another. 

1. Efficient handling of large projects
    - Torvalds has described Git as being very fast and scalable.

1. Fundamental assumption is collaboration and sharing
    - Opensource in principle, and to the core of the system
