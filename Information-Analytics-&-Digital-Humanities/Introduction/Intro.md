## Version Control System

^ Git was created by Linus Torvalds in 2005 for development of the Linux kernel, with other kernel developers contributing to its initial development. Its current maintainer is Junio Hamano.

^ As with most other distributed version control systems, and unlike most clientâ€“server systems, every Git directory on every computer is a full-fledged repository with complete history and full version-tracking capabilities, independent of network access or a central server.

^ Like the Linux kernel, Git is free software distributed under the terms of the GNU General Public License version 2.

^ The name "git" was given by Linus Torvalds when he wrote the very first version. He described the tool as "the stupid content tracker" and the name as (depending on your mood)

1. Efficient handling of large projects
    - Torvalds has described Git as being very fast and scalable.

1. Fundamental assumption is collaboration and sharing
    - Opensource in principle, and to the core of the system
