# Readings for Week 4
# Statistical Inference

Here are the readings for next week. Please do read Number 1 -- don't be put off by the title. It is fairly long, but an excellent introduction to statistics. I would also like you all to read Number 2 which is shorter, but gives more on the abuses of statistical inference. 

I have also included two other resources here for those who are keen or would like to do more in the future. Number 3 is a bit dated, but remains one of the best works on "How to Lie with Statistics". Number 4 is a link to a series of podcasts which are a detailed introduction to statistics. Do these only if you want to go on with statistics.

All of these are in the Week 4 Readings folder on GitHub
