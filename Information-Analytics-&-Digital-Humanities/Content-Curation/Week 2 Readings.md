# Readings Week 2

Here are two readings for you to do BEFORE the class. Please come prepared to discuss.

    - Digital Curation for Digital natives (Liz Yakel et al, 2011)
    - Ontology is overrated (Clay Shirky, 2009)

Also have a look at the resources and guidance offered by the Collection Trust (UK). This is one of the key accreditation organisations in the world. Dig around, and don't forget to be skeptical and critical.
